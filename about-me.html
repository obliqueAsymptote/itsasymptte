                        If I had to introduce myself in as many adjectives in one sentence as possible to grab your attention,
                        I'm an <i>18 year-old, hard-working and ambitious, esteemed and educated girl from the US.</i> I have an undying
                        obsession with <i>computer science</i> and <i>math</i>, striving to teach myself something new everyday and
                        push myself beyond my limits. I <b>never</b> like to settle and I want to exceed my peers by a far mile, and I'd like
                        to think that this drive of mine has gotten me <i>a lot</i> of places that I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. This isn't
                        me being cocky, this is me genuinely acknowledging that my <i>capacity to learn</i> is directly under my control so 
                        like any rational person, it must be taken advantage of.

                            I've <i>always</i> been into computer from a young age. I used to try to constantly bypass controls my parents would put on me
                            which familiarized me with powershell and vpns and unbeknownst to them, <i>sparked</i> a drive in me.<br>I then self taught myself
                            basic <i>front-end web dev</i> at <b>12</b> very poorly and never went anywhere with it because I was too busy writing fanfictions about my favorite
                            animes LOL<br>Then once I hit my teenage years, my parents thought it was a good idea to take me to <i>europe</i> to study abroad for the duration
                            of my life before adulthood, as I was <i>excelling</i> beyond what the US education system could challenge me on. It was there that I did 
                            <i>computer science</i> at <b>GCSE</b> and <b>A-level</b>, reaching A's across each assessment and coursework.<br>I had familiarized myself with <i>python</i>
                            at late <b>13</b>/early <b>14</b> and didn't take it seriously until I reached <b>16</b>, when I started my A-level. We would be given class assignments in groups
                            to do simple programs like <i>calculating football tickets</i>, making a simple <i>web scraper</i> (BS4 THE GOAT)!!!<br> That's when I realized I couldn't excel as 
                            long as the idea of APIs and JSON parsing was <i>foreign</i> to me. That sparked this absolute lock in which made me go from a novice in python
                            to <b>not only</b> knowing it now innately with <i>advanced</i> paradigms, but also picking up <i>C++</i>, daily driving <i>linux</i>, and even teaching myself <i>college
                            level maths</i> to better understand algorithms. Genuinely within a little over a year, I had <b>exceeded</b> people I used to look up to.

                            Near
                            the end of my A-levels, we had mandated coursework worth <b>20%</b> of our full grade over the <b>2</b> years. I took the opportunity to push myself as I
                            thought I'd never get the chance to give myself a <i>straight few months</i> to work on something. This started my rabbithole of <b>AI</b>, specifically
                            <b>deep learning</b>. While others were struggling on whether to do a measly quiz app with simple SQL queries or a weather app using the same weather
                            API every new CS student uses, I was adamant on doing a <b>facial recognition control system</b>.<br>However an issue came to light: I knew absolutely
                            <i>zilch</i> about how AI worked. Now, given I am an incredibly <i>adaptable</i> person, I <i>persisted</i>. I taught myself <b>linear algebra</b> and <b>calculus</b> so I could
                            get the hang of matrices for datasets, and <b>backpropagation</b> to better work with my model. I would stay up watching 3blue1brown videos to 
                            <i>better understand</i> how neural networks worked, I differentiated between <b>supervised</b>, <b>unsupervised</b>, <b>reinforcement</b> learning, I delved into <b>recurrent</b>
                            vs. <b>convolutional</b> networks- It felt like I was destined to be in this <i>subgenre</i> of CS. The <i>math</i>, combined with the <i>control</i> I was given, this obsessive
                            drive skyrocketed.<br>Now granted I was only given about <i>4 months</i> to do this project and I was balancing other subjects and studying to death
                            to rightfully gain one of the <i>top students in the whole college</i> (which I earned a plaque for :3), I had to abstract my project a bit. I didn't use raw 
                            libraries to train models myself, however I had to <i>store encodings</i> myself and give my program a <i>threshold</i> of a percentage match up of a face stored in the 
                            SQL database that was decent enough. Additionally, I had to use numpy to reduce false positives that were being picked up. Everytime I resented myself for not being the <b>reincarnation of terry davis himself</b>, I'd mediate myself by saying
                            at least I'm getting my foot in the door.<br>Well, I certaintly did; I got the <i>hightest</i> in my class and I had a <i>working</i> face recognition access system.
                            I continued with my studies and worked hard to understand the theory: <i>Logic circuits, different network devices, boolean algebra, addressing modes and 
                            reference vs value parameter passing. </i> I had consumed <i>so much</i> knowledge that when it came to exam time where I'd witness people have uncontrollable 
                            breakdowns, I'd take the exam for the whole <b>2</b> hours and a half smiling, seeing it as a <i>challenge</i>.

                            Now let's rewind a bit- since my college was 2 years from <b>16</b> to <b>18</b>, I had met my ex-boyfriend at 17 who <i>opened up</i> the door to <b>cybersecurity</b>. I quickly
                            picked up a lot in that field; Linux cli <b>tools, CVE POCs, opsec, social engineering</b>, and I even went down the rabbithole of telegram groupchats.<br>Let me
                            preface by saying I was never involved in anything illicit, I mean these kids were pretty harmless. They <i>vibe-coded</i> (god i love that word) a barely working UI and couldn't tell
                            the difference between a <i>1D</i> and <i>2D</i> array. When I had met my ex-boyfriend, I was a complete <i>novice</i> at this and programming and by the end of my relationship,
                            I had exceeded him by a <i>far mile</i> and ended my relationship with him.<br>I'm not here to trauma dump on people who come and go in my life, this is to simply
                            <i>inform</i> on my journey to who I am <i>today</i> and who I will continue to grow <i>to be</i>.

                            After I finished my A levels in early <b>july</b> of <b>2025</b>, I couldn't attend university where I was residing as I had better options coming back to the <i>USA</i>, so that
                            is exactly what I did. My mom supported me and <i>we all relocated</i> back to the states and applied for top universities in my state. Funnily enough, I even changed
                            majors. Originally I was going to major in <b>IT</b> but I realized that my brain was <i>more geared</i> for tackling <i>challeneges</i> in software and coming up with efficient methods
                            in solving problems rather than routine IT protocols. And further, as my love for <i>solving math problems</i> in my free time flourished, naturally I gravitated towards a <b>bachelors</b>
                            in <b>computer science</b>. So I spent my whole summer <i>brushing up</i> on any math I'll need during uni and <i>advancing</i> my coding skills to the point where my first 2 years
                            of university content looked like a revision session than learning new content LOL.
